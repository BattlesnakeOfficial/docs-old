# Starter Projects

## Official Starter Projects

These projects are built and maintained by the Battlesnake team. We do our best to keep them functional and up-to-date with the latest game features.

If you're building a Battlesnake for the first time, these are great starting points.

* [Python Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-python)
* [Go Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-go)
* [JavaScript Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-node)

There are also a few older projects that require some updating to work with the latest API, but are still helpful for getting started.

* J[ava Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-java) _\(needs upgrading\)_
* [Ruby Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-ruby) _\*\*\(needs upgrading\)_

**Have an idea to make these better?**  
We welcome pull requests and issues on all official Starter Project GitHub repos. See our [Contributing Guide](../guides/contributing.md) for instructions and guidelines.

Our [Java Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-java) and [Ruby Starter Project](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/starter-snake-ruby) both need updating to API version 1.0. If you are interested in helping, check out the following issues in GitHub:

## Contributing Your Own Starter Project

**Want to submit your Starter Project to this list?** Wonderful!

You can submit a [pull request or create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/docs) and we'll take a look. Community created Starter Projects must follow these guidelines in order to be approved:

* Contain just enough code to run a simple Battlesnake and nothing more
* Return hardcoded responses to all requests
* Be well documented and easy to understand
* Provide simple, extensible unit tests
* Ideally have a minimal project structure
