# Starter Projects

## Official Starter Projects

These projects are built and maintained by the Battlesnake team. We do our best to keep them functional and up-to-date with the latest game features.

If you're building a Battlesnake for the first time, these are great starting points.

**Legacy Starter Projects**

The following starter projects use a deprecated version of the Battlesnake API. They're still great starting points, but require some additional updates to work correctly. See [Migrating to API Version 1](starter-projects.md) for details.

## Contributing Your Own Starter Project

**Want to submit your Starter Project to this list?** Wonderful!

You can submit a [pull request or create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/docs) and we'll take a look. Community created Starter Projects must follow these guidelines in order to be approved:

* Contain just enough code to run a simple Battlesnake and nothing more
* Return hardcoded responses to all requests
* Be well documented and easy to understand
* Provide simple, extensible unit tests
* Ideally have a minimal project structure
