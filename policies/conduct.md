# Code of Conduct

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/docs/tree/8f1f979f7a8bd74d48422c0ed8dff238c1110ba1/policies/code\_of\_conduct.md)

We created Battlesnake as a way to have fun programming with friends, learn new skills and technologies, and build the communities around us. We firmly believe that encouraging more people to experience and enjoy programming at all levels will make the world a better place. To this end we have created a Community with a focus on building experiences which are:

### Accessible

Battlesnake is for everyone. Whether you are new to programming or have been a professional developer for 30+ years, you can find a place at Battlesnake to learn, grow and be successful. Everyone should have the tools, support, and access to code, collaborate and compete at Battlesnake.

### Inclusive

Battlesnake is an inclusive community. This means we are welcoming and respectful of all Battlesnake community members. As our community grows and more people join with different backgrounds and skills, we will see a stronger and more vibrant community.

### Collaborative

Battlesnake is a place for collaboration. Developers from around the world are here to learn, grow, and connect with other developers. At all times you should take a collaborative approach to any problem that is presented, whether it is technical or not.

{% hint style="info" %}
By adopting this Code of Conduct, Battlesnake community members commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of Battlesnake and its communities. Any persons who do not follow this Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the Battlesnake platform and barred from all future events.
